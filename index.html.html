<p> The Kangal sheperd dog is the tenth largest dog on the planet and can reach an impressive weight of over 160 ibs. These dogs were breed in Turkey for the purpose of guarding livestock such as Sheep from other wild beasts such as Wolves. The dogs also hold the record of having the strongest bite in the canine universe, at over 700psi these dogs possess a stronger bite than even a lion which has a bite force of about 650psi. All though these dogs are independent they are also very loving and affectionate towards their family. They are not suitable for novice or inexperienced owners as they can be quite difficult to train</p><br/><br/>

<p> One of my personal favorite breeds the neapolitan mastiff which can weight between 185-190 ibs. These dogs originated from Italy and were bred as guard dogs for families. The dog just like other mastiff dog breeds is a descendant of the ancient and now extinct molossus and breed of war dog from greece used for protection and gladiator fights. Just like their antestor these dogs possess a large head and protective instinct. They are easily identified by their wrinkly face. The are stubborn, independent, difficult to train and not suitable for novince or first time owners</p>.<br/>

 <p> Another one of my favorite breeds the Great dane takes the number 5 spot on our list and can weigh as much as 200 1bs 91 kg. Although thought by some to originate from denmark this behemoth hound actually originates from Germany. It is a cross between the Irish wolfhound and English mastiff which are both ginormous dogs in their own right. This hell of a hound was bred for hunting big game such as Wild boar but today are gaint friendly couch potatoes that are calm gentle and loving to their families. Great danes are also believed to have the ability to chase away ghosts and evils spirits afterall scooby doo is a greatdane<img src="file:///C:/Users/DELL/Pictures/Screenshot_20220105-115111_1.png" width="300px" height="400px">. Unfortunately just like the leonberger the Great dane also has a relatively short lifespan of 6-8 years but these dogs will give loads of love and affection on their days on earth.</p><br/><br/>
